## 0.5.0 (2021-09-23)

- Refactor XvcEntity to `(u64, u64)`
  - Issue: <https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/issues/198>
  - PR: <https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/pulls/201>
  - `From<u128>` and `Into<u128>`
  - `From<(u64, u64)>` and `Into<(u64, u64)>`
  - Tests
    - Add tests for `From<u128>` and `Into<u128>` ecs/src/ecs/mod.rs
    - Fix doc tests that use `100usize` to create `XvcEntity`
  - Update the ECS documentation
    - Update arch/ecs.md
    - Search for any `XvcEntity` references that may be changed
- `xvc-test-helper` binary is not produced at builds
  - Moved it from dev-dependencies to dependencies in workflow_tests/Cargo.toml
    - Still doesn't work üõë
    - We need binary dependencies in cargo: <https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3028-cargo-binary-dependencies.html>,
    - It's available in nightly: <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9096>
    - Revert to dev-dependencies
  - `z_test_docs` fails immediately if no `xvc-test-helper` binary is found.
  - Run the tests without `-p workflow_tests`
    - Hypothesis: The reason the test helper binary is not produced is that we run only `workflow_tests` crate.
    - Looks this hypothesis is not correct.
  - The best way seems to be adding
    <https://docs.rs/escargot/latest/escargot/> and building the binary before
    the doc tests.
    - Now builds the binary before running the doc tests. ‚úÖ
- Write pipelines code documentation <https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/issues/88>
- Add `xvc file copy` command
  - Issue: https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/issues/179
  - PR: https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/issues/206
  - Create the user interface
    - Add `copy` to `XvcFileCLI`
    - Created CopyCLI
  - Write the documentation and doc tests:
    - Write initial examples: book/src/ref/xvc-file-copy.md
    - Create a fixture directory `xvc-file-copy.in`
  - Implement the command
    - Select source
    - Select destination
      - Do we store directories with trailing / or not‚ùì
        - Write tests for consistency
          - Added `test_xvc_path_naming` proptests and modified XvcPath
            constructor to accept absolute paths conditionally. ‚úÖ
        - We don't store directories with trailing / ‚ÑπÔ∏è
      - Create destination XvcPaths ‚úÖ
        - Add join function to XvcPath ‚úÖ
      - Create destination cache type, metadata, digest, text-or-binary ‚úÖ
      - Should we create destination directory records‚ùì
        - It's better to create them to update gitignore files. ‚úÖ
      - Update gitignore files in destinations
        - Use update_dir_gitignore for new directories and update_file_gitignore for new files.
        - Move gitignore functions from track/mod.rs to common/gitignore.rs
          - Gitignore handling is actually a recheck sub-operation.
            - Git doesn't mind if we don't create anything in the workspace.
            - We should update gitignores in recheck, but how can we do that for
              directories that may contain non-tracked files‚ùì
            - While creating files and parent directories we can update gitignores
              in the parent directories.
               - If a directory is not already ignored in creation, we can
                 create a gitignore with a single line `*` to ignore all files.
               - After all files are rechecked, we can check whether they are
                 not ignored by Git, and update necessary gitignores.
        - Create an IgnoreWriter system with crossbeam_channels
          - The channel will send/receive Option<IgnoreOperation> messages.
          - If it receives a None message, it will stop and the collected
            dir/files will be written to ignore files.
          - This pattern can be used for all operations.
      - Split targets_from_store to receive a store struct to filter. ‚úÖ
        - This is to prevent unnecessary reload in copy.
      - Convert former XvcRoot type to XvcRootInner and XvcRoot to Arc<XvcRootInner>
        - This is to pass the object to threads easily.
  - Updated default format string for `xvc file list`
    - Moved `name` block to the end of the format string ‚úÖ
