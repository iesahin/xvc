# How to create a data pipeline with Xvc

A data pipeline starts from data and ends with models. 

```console
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in [CWD]/.git/

$ xvc init
```

In this HOWTO, we use Chinese MNIST dataset to create an image classification pipeline. We already downloaded it [from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/chinese-mnist/data). 

```console
$ ls -l
total 21080
-rw-r--r--  1 iex  staff  10792680 Nov 17 19:46 chinese_mnist.zip

```
Let's start by tracking the data file with Xvc.

```console
$ xvc file track chinese_mnist.zip --as symlink

```

The default [recheck (checkout) method](/ref/xvc-file-recheck.md) is _copy_ that means the file is
duplicated in the workspace as a writable file. We don't need to write over this
data file, we'll only read from it, so we set the recheck type as symlink.

```console
$ ls -l
total 0
lrwxr-xr-x  1 iex  staff  192 Nov 17 22:06 chinese_mnist.zip -> [CWD]/.xvc/b3/b24/2c9/422f91b804ea3008bc0bc025e97bf50c1d902ae7a0f13588b84f59023d/0.zip

```

The long directory name is the BLAKE-3 hash of the data file.

As we'll work with the file contents, let's unzip the data file.

```console
$ unzip -q chinese_mnist.zip

$ ls -l
total 0
lrwxr-xr-x  1 iex  staff  192 Nov 17 22:06 chinese_mnist.zip -> [CWD]/.xvc/b3/b24/2c9/422f91b804ea3008bc0bc025e97bf50c1d902ae7a0f13588b84f59023d/0.zip
drwxr-xr-x  4 iex  staff  128 Nov 17 19:45 data

```

Now we have the data directory with the following structure:

```console
$ tree data
```

Let's track the data directory as well with Xvc.

```console
$ xvc file track data --as symlink
```

The reason we're tracking the data directory separately is that we'll use different subsets as training, validation, and test data. 


Let's list the track status of files first. 

```console
$ xvc file list data/
```


$ xvc pipeline step new -s convert-docx-to-txt --command "./convert-docx-to-txt.zsh" 
```
