## 0.5.2 (2023-02-13)

- Refactor "cache type" to "recheck method" in all code and documentation
  - Issue: <https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/issues/203>
  - Renamed `CacheType` to `RecheckMethod`
  - Revised documentation for recheck methods
- Add `xvc file untrack` command.
  - Issue: <https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/issues/113>
  - Write the reference page: book/src/ref/xvc-file-untrack.md
    - I believe there must be two separate commands: `xvc file untrack` and `xvc file remove`. The former is to remove the file from Xvc tracking, and the latter is to remove the file from the workspace, cache, or storages. There are valid use cases to remove the file from cache without untracking it, and vice versa.
    - There will also be a `xvc file versions` command to list the versions of a file and restore them to a directory.
    - I think it's better to implement remove and untrack commands in one go.
    - Added `join` to AbsolutePath.
      - Assert the parameter is not absolute.
        - Caused error in xvc init: Fixed ✅
        - Caused error in updating gitignores: Fixed ✅
    - Error in recheck for existing paths: Fixed ✅
    - XvcCachePath returns a partial path for reporting
    - Change all PathBuf elements in XvcRoot to AbsolutePath
    - Sort results of `--restore-versions` by entity id ✅
    - Delete cache files
    - Remove empty directories after untracking ✅
  - Update book/src/start/from-dvc.md for `xvc file untrack` ✅
- Restructure output channel to send/receive `Option<XvcOutputLine>` instead of `XvcOutputLine`
  - Refactor all commands to use the new output channel ✅
- Add `xvc file remove` command
  - Add RemoveCLI and the command dispatcher ✅
  - Implemented remove for local cache
    - Implement `--all-versions`
    - Implement `--only-version`
  - Implement `--from-remote`
  - Implement `XvcStorageOperations::delete` for all storage types
- Update `xvc-test-helper generate-random-file` and `create-directory-tree` to receive random seed
- Update `xvc storage new local` ref page to include examples

    - New makes the generator dirty. Load doesn't.
- Add `xvc file move` command.
  - Issue: <https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/issues/177>
  - Write the reference page: book/src/ref/xvc-file-move.md
  - Add `move` to `XvcFileCLI`
  - Add MoveCLI

  - `xvc file move --no-recheck` deletes the source files.
- Added Giscus to the documentation
  - PR: <https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/pull/215>
  - All docs pages can be commented with Giscus.

## 0.5.0 (2023-01-23)

- Refactor XvcEntity to `(u64, u64)`
  - Issue: <https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/issues/198>
  - PR: <https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/pulls/201>

  - Update the ECS documentation
    - Update arch/ecs.md
    - Search for any `XvcEntity` references that may be changed
- `xvc-test-helper` binary is not produced at builds
  - Moved it from dev-dependencies to dependencies in workflow_tests/Cargo.toml
    - Still doesn't work 🛑
    - We need binary dependencies in cargo: <https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3028-cargo-binary-dependencies.html>,
    - It's available in nightly: <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9096>
    - Revert to dev-dependencies
  - `z_test_docs` fails immediately if no `xvc-test-helper` binary is found.
  - Run the tests without `-p workflow_tests`
    - Hypothesis: The reason the test helper binary is not produced is that we run only `workflow_tests` crate.
    - Looks this hypothesis is not correct.
  - The best way seems to be adding
    <https://docs.rs/escargot/latest/escargot/> and building the binary before
    the doc tests.
    - Now builds the binary before running the doc tests. ✅
- Write pipelines code documentation <https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/issues/88>
- Add `xvc file copy` command
  - Issue: <https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/issues/179>
  - PR: <https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/issues/206>
  - Create the user interface
    - Add `copy` to `XvcFileCLI`
    - Created CopyCLI
  - Write the documentation and doc tests:
    - Write initial examples: book/src/ref/xvc-file-copy.md
    - Create a fixture directory `xvc-file-copy.in`
  - Implement the command
    - Select source
    - Select destination
      - Do we store directories with trailing / or not❓
        - Write tests for consistency
          - Added `test_xvc_path_naming` proptests and modified XvcPath
            constructor to accept absolute paths conditionally. ✅
        - We don't store directories with trailing / ℹ️
      - Create destination XvcPaths ✅
        - Add join function to XvcPath ✅
      - Create destination cache type, metadata, digest, text-or-binary ✅
      - Should we create destination directory records❓
        - It's better to create them to update gitignore files. ✅
      - Update gitignore files in destinations
        - Use update_dir_gitignore for new directories and update_file_gitignore for new files.
        - Move gitignore functions from track/mod.rs to common/gitignore.rs
          - Gitignore handling is actually a recheck sub-operation.
            - Git doesn't mind if we don't create anything in the workspace.
            - We should update gitignores in recheck, but how can we do that for
              directories that may contain non-tracked files❓
            - While creating files and parent directories we can update gitignores
              in the parent directories.
              - If a directory is not already ignored in creation, we can create a gitignore with a single line `*` to ignore all files.
              - After all files are rechecked, we can check whether they are not ignored by Git, and update necessary gitignores.
        - Create an IgnoreWriter system with crossbeam_channels
          - The channel will send/receive `Option<IgnoreOperation>` messages.
          - If it receives a None message, it will stop and the collected
            dir/files will be written to ignore files.
          - This pattern can be used for all operations.
      - Split targets_from_store to receive a store struct to filter. ✅
        - This is to prevent unnecessary reload in copy.
      - Convert former XvcRoot type to XvcRootInner and XvcRoot to `Arc<XvcRootInner>`
        - This is to pass the object to threads easily.
  - Updated default format string for `xvc file list`
    - Moved `name` block to the end of the format string ✅
