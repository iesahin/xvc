Manage your unstructured data next to code in Git repositories and run commands when they change. 

## ‚åõ Why Xvc?

- You have image, audio, media, document or asset files to [track/version/backup](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-file-track) along with the code, but [don't want to copy](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-file-recheck) that huge data to all Git clones.
- You want to [manage](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-file-list) unstructured data in multiple places with [multiple subsets](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-file-copy), some (e.g. data) being read-only and some (e.g. models, executables) change frequently. 
- You want to store this data in local, SSH-accessible, or S3-compatible cloud storages to share along the repository. 
- You want write commands that run when only this data changes, define pipelines with steps that run when only their dependencies change.
- You want to define these dependencies with files, globs spanning multiple files, ext file lines described by regexes, URLs, parameters in the YAML or JSON files, SQLite queries or any command that produces output. You want to run the pipeline commands only when their dependencies change.

  <summary> <strong> üîΩ Installation</strong></summary>

You can get the binary files for Linux, macOS, and Windows from [releases](https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/releases/latest) page. Extract and copy the file to your `$PATH`.

Alternatively, if you have Rust [installed], you can build xvc:

```shell
$ cargo install xvc
```

[installed]: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

If you want to use Xvc with Python console and Jupyter notebooks, you can also install it with `pip`:

```shell
$ pip install xvc
```

Note that pip installation doesn't make `xvc` available as a shell command. Please see [xvc.py](https://github.com/iesahin/xvc.py) for details.


### Completions

Xvc supports dynamic completions for bash, zsh, elvish, fish and powershell. For example, run the following to add completions for bash:

```bash
echo "source <(COMPLETE=bash xvc)" >> ~/.bashrc
```

See [Completions](https://docs.xvc.dev/intro/completions) for others.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>üöÄ Initialize a directory for Xvc</strong></summary>

```console
$ git init # if you're not already in a Git repository
Initialized empty Git repository in [CWD]/.git/

$ xvc init
```

This command initializes the `.xvc/` directory and adds a `.xvcignore` file for specifying paths you wish to conceal from Xvc.

  > [!TIP]
  > Git is **not required** to run Xvc. However running Xvc with Git is usually a
  > good idea. Xvc can stage/commit metadata files (under `.xvc/`) used to track
  > binary files and you can use branches for versioning as well.
  > 
  > If you don't want to use Xvc with Git, use `--no-git` option when
  > initializing.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>üïµÔ∏è Track Files</summary>

Include your data files and directories for tracking:

```shell
$ xvc file track my-data/
```

This command calculates content hashes for data (using BLAKE-3, by default) and logs them. Files are copied to content-addressed directories within `.xvc/b3`. Then, they are copied to the workspace. 

  > [!TIP]
  > You can specify different [recheck (checkout)
  > methods](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-file-recheck/) for files and
  > directories, depending on your use case. Symlinks and hardlinks to the
  > files under Xvc cache don't consume additional space but they are readonly.
  > You can also use (copy-on-write) reflinks if your file system supports it
  > and Xvc is built with `reflink` feature. 

</details>

<details>
<summary>ü´ß Checkout a subset of files as symlinks</summary>

  You can copy and recheck (checkout) subsets of files from Xvc cache as symlinks to create multiple _views_. 

```console
$ xvc file copy my-data/ another-view-to-my-data/
$ xvc file recheck another-view-to-my-data/ --as symlink
```
  > [!TIP]
  > `xvc file copy` and `xvc file move` doesn't require file contents to be
  > available. Xvc works only with their metadata and you can organize files
  > without their content copied to workspace or cache. 
  
  > [!TIP]
  > If you installed completions to your shell, Xvc completes file names even
  > if they are not available in the workspace. 

</details>

<details>
<summary>üåÅ Send files to the cloud services</summary>

Configure a cloud storage to share the files you track with Xvc.

```shell
$ xvc storage new s3 --name my-storage --region us-east-1 --bucket-name my-xvc-remote
```

You can send the files to this storage.

```shell
$ xvc file send --to my-storage
```

You can also send a subset of the files.

```shell
$ xvc file send 'my-data/training/*' --to my-xvc-remote
```

Xvc [supports](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-storage-new) [external directories](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-storage-new-local), [Rsync](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-storage-new-rsync), [AWS S3](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-storage-new-s3), [Google Cloud Storage](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-storage-new-gcs), [MinIO](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-storage-new-minio), [Cloudflare R2](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-storage-new-r2), [Wasabi](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-storage-new-wasabi), [Digital Ocean Spaces](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-storage-new-digital-ocean). Please [create an issue](https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) if you want Xvc to support another cloud storage service.

> [!TIP]
> Xvc supports any command to upload/download files. If your favorite service
> is not listed or you want to use another tool (s5cmd, rclone, etc.), you can
> specify a [generic](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-storage-new-generic)
> storage by supplying shell commands to upload and download. 

> [!WARNING]
> Xvc never stores credentials to your connections and expects them to be
> available in the environment. It never makes remote connections without cloud
> related commands (to track usage, etc.) and you can compile without cloud
> connection support in case you want to make sure that it makes no connections
> to outside services.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Get Files from S3 (and compatible) services</summary>
When you (or someone else) want to access these files later, you can clone the Git repository and get the files from the
storage.

```shell
$ git clone https://example.com/my-machine-learning-project
Cloning into 'my-machine-learning-project'...

$ cd my-machine-learning-project
$ xvc file bring my-data/ --from my-storage

```

This approach ensures convenient access to files from the shared storage when needed.

You don't have to reconfigure the storage after cloning, but you need to have valid credentials as environment variables
to access the storage.
Xvc never stores any credentials.

<details>
<summary>Create a pipeline</summary>

For this example, we'll use [a Python script](https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/blob/main/workflow_tests/templates/README.in/generate_data.py) to generate a data set with random names with random IQ scores.

The script uses the Faker library and this library must be available where you run the pipeline. To make it repeatable, we start the pipeline by adding a step that installs dependencies.

```console
$ xvc pipeline step new --step-name install-deps --command 'python3 -m pip install --quiet --user -r requirements.txt'
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Add a dependency to a pipeline step</summary>

If you have commands that depend on data or code elements, you can configure a pipeline.

We'll make this this step to depend on `requirements.txt` file, so when the file changes it will make the step run.

```console
$ xvc pipeline step dependency --step-name install-deps --file requirements.txt
```

Xvc allows to create dependencies between pipeline steps. Dependent steps wait for dependencies to finish successfully.

Now we create a step to run the script and make `install-deps` step a dependency of it.

```console
$ xvc pipeline step new --step-name generate-data --command 'python3 generate_data.py'
$ xvc pipeline step dependency --step-name generate-data --step install-deps
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Run pipeline</summary>

After you define the pipeline, you can run it by:

```console
$ xvc pipeline run
[DONE] install-deps (python3 -m pip install --quiet --user -r requirements.txt)
[OUT] [generate-data] CSV file generated successfully.

[DONE] generate-data (python3 generate_data.py)

```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Add fine grained dependencies to steps</summary>

Xvc allows many kinds of dependencies, like [files](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-pipeline-step-dependency#file-dependencies),
[groups of files and directories defined by globs](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-pipeline-step-dependency#glob-dependencies),
[regular expression searches in files](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-pipeline-step-dependency#regex-dependencies),
[line ranges in files](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-pipeline-step-dependency#line-dependencies),
[hyper-parameters defined in YAML, JSON or TOML files](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-pipeline-step-dependency#hyper-parameter-dependencies)
[HTTP URLs](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-pipeline-step-dependency#url-dependencies),
[shell command outputs](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-pipeline-step-dependency#generic-command-dependencies),
and [other steps](https://docs.xvc.dev/ref/xvc-pipeline-step-dependency#step-dependencies).

Suppose you're only interested in the IQ scores of those with _Dr._ in front of their names and how they differ from the rest in the dataset we created. Let's create a regex search dependency to the data file that will show all _doctors_ IQ scores.

```console
$ xvc pipeline step new --step-name dr-iq --command 'echo "${XVC_ADDED_REGEX_ITEMS}" >> dr-iq-scores.csv '
$ xvc pipeline step dependency --step-name dr-iq --regex-items 'random_names_iq_scores.csv:/^Dr\..*'
```

The first line specifies a command, when run writes `${XVC_ADDED_REGEX_ITEMS}` environment variable to `dr-iq-scores.csv` file.
The second line specifies the dependency which will also populate the `$[XVC_ADDED_REGEX_ITEMS]` environment variable in the command.

Some dependency types like [regex items],
[line items] and [glob items] inject environment variables in the commands they are a dependency.
For example, if you have two million files specified with a glob, but want to run a script only on the added files after the last run, you can use these environment variables.

When you run the pipeline again, a file named `dr-iq-scores.csv` will be created. Note that, as `requirements.txt` didn't change `install-deps` step and its dependent `generate-data` steps didn't run.

```console
$ xvc pipeline run
[DONE] dr-iq (echo "${XVC_ADDED_REGEX_ITEMS}" >> dr-iq-scores.csv )

$ cat dr-iq-scores.csv
Dr. Brian Shaffer,122
Dr. Brittany Chang,82
Dr. Mallory Payne MD,70
Dr. Sherry Leonard,93
Dr. Susan Swanson,81

```

We are using this feature to get lines starting with `Dr.` from the file and write them to another file. When the file changes, e.g. another record matching the dependency regex added to the `random_names_iq_scores.csv` file, it will also be added to `dr-iq-scores.csv` file.

```console
$ zsh -cl 'echo "Dr. Albert Einstein,144" >> random_names_iq_scores.csv'

$ xvc pipeline run
[DONE] dr-iq (echo "${XVC_ADDED_REGEX_ITEMS}" >> dr-iq-scores.csv )

$ cat dr-iq-scores.csv
Dr. Brian Shaffer,122
Dr. Brittany Chang,82
Dr. Mallory Payne MD,70
Dr. Sherry Leonard,93
Dr. Susan Swanson,81
Dr. Albert Einstein,144

```

Now we want to add a another command that draws a fancy histogram from `dr-iq-scores.csv`. As this new step must wait `dr-iq-scores.csv` file to be ready, we'll define `dr-iq-scores.csv` as an _output_ of `dr-iq` step and set the file as a dependency to this new `visualize` step.

```console
$ xvc pipeline step output --step-name dr-iq --output-file dr-iq-scores.csv
$ xvc pipeline step new --step-name visualize --command 'python3 visualize.py'
$ xvc pipeline step dependency --step-name visualize --file dr-iq-scores.csv
$ xvc pipeline run
[ERROR] Step visualize finished UNSUCCESSFULLY with command python3 visualize.py

```
</details>


<details>
<summary>Visualize a pipeline in Graphviz or Mermaid</summary>

You can get the pipeline in Graphviz DOT format to convert to an image.

```console
$ zsh -cl 'xvc pipeline dag --format graphviz | dot -opipeline.png'

```

You can also ask for a [mermaid.js]() diagram;


```console
xvc pipeline dag --format mermaid
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Export a pipeline in YAML or JSON format</summary>
You can also export and import the pipeline to JSON to edit in your editor.

```console
$ xvc pipeline export --file my-pipeline.json

$ cat my-pipeline.json

## üèÉüèæ Quicktart

Please create an issue or discussion for any other kinds of dependencies that you'd like to be included.

I'm planning to add [data label and annotations tracking](https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/discussions/208)), [experiments tracking](https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/discussions/207)), [model tracking](https://github.com/iesahin/xvc/discussions/211)), encrypted cache, server to control all commands from a web interface, and more as my time permits.

Please check [`docs.xvc.dev`](https://docs.xvc.dev) for documentation.

## ü§ü Big Thanks

xvc stands on the following (giant) crates:

- [trycmd] is used to run all example commands in this file, [reference, and how-to documentation](https://docs.xvc.dev) at
  every PR. It makes sure that the documentation is always up-to-date and shown commands work as described. We start
  development by writing documentation and implementing them thanks to [trycmd].

- [serde] allows all data structures to be stored in text files. Special thanks from [`xvc-ecs`] for serializing components in an ECS with a single line of code.

- Xvc processes files in parallel with pipelines and parallel iterators thanks to [crossbeam] and [rayon].

- Thanks to [strum], Xvc uses enums extensively and converts almost everything to typed values from strings.

- Xvc has a deep CLI that has subcommands of subcommands (e.g. `xvc storage new s3`), and all these work with minimum bugs thanks to [clap].

- Xvc uses [rust-s3] to connect to S3 and compatible storage services. It employs excellent [tokio] for fast async Rust. These cloud storage features can be turned off thanks to Rust conditional compilation.

- Without implementations of [BLAKE3], BLAKE2, SHA-2 and SHA-3 from Rust [crypto] crate, Xvc couldn't detect file changes so fast.

- Many thanks to small and well built crates, [reflink], [relative-path], [path-absolutize], [glob] for file system and glob handling.

- Thanks to [sad_machine] for providing a State Machine implementation that I used in `xvc pipeline run`. A DAG composed of State Machines made running pipeline steps in parallel with a clean separation of process states.

- Thanks to [thiserror] and [anyhow] for making error handling a breeze. These two crates make me feel I'm doing something good for the humanity when handling errors.

- Xvc is split into many crates and owes this organization to [cargo workspaces].
