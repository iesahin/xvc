      - Recursive option
        - If not given all files including the ignored files will be reported.
          - Ignored files will be reported with file type `I`
      - Add `G` for as a file type for git-tracked files.
      - `DX         224 2022-12-31 08:21:11   dir-0001/dir-0001  rcd \n`
        - Fix `rcd` ‚úÖ
      - Count lines in the result
        - I think it's better to write all of this as a doc test
- create a `xvc-test-helper create-directory-hierarchy` command.
  - Add a main.rs to xvc-test-helper ‚úÖ
  - Add clap to parse CLI
    - Add subcommands ‚úÖ
      - create directory tree
      - random dir name --prefix str --seed u64
      - random temp dir --prefix str
      - seeded temp dir --seed u64
      - create temp dir
      - run in temp dir

      - began to add `xvc-file-list.md`
        - Open doc test results in a directory
          - Use neovim for this
      - It looks we need to update directory permissions in the cache too
        - updated move_to_cache function
      - fix recheck errors
        - it looks recheck doesn't check whether the file is changed before trying to checkout
        - do we use `--text-or-binary` option to update the file?
          - removed the option from help text ‚úÖ
        - I think we need a `DEBUG` level in XvcOutput for otherwise irrelevant information

      - fix `carry-in` errors

          - fixed ‚úÖ
      - the sorting for timestamp and size are not working
        - fixed ‚úÖ
      - if a field is blank or None, it should print spaces.
        - Done for size and timestamp ‚úÖ
    - Why the cache size is empty when they are not reported
      - Fixed. Loads the rec content digests always now. ‚úÖ
    - We need more tests for other sorting options to increase coverage perhaps.
      - removed older tests and added only the sorting test to xvc file list wf tests
      - tests in ref md is larger than this file anyway.
    - Listing only the changed.
      - As a status command.
  - Fix `xvc file hash` tests

    - There is a failing command, which one?
      - It looks like a plain recheck after hardlink
      - The target permissions should be removed
    - The bug seems to be in `xvc file track`
      - There is a gitignore bug
        - Fixed it by using the targets directly
    - The failure is in cleanup, about permissions.
      - Delete files and directories one by one
        - Deleted by shell ‚úÖ
  - Fix `xvc root`
    - `--debug` should only determine the xvc.log output
