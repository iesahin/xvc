## Examples

This command removes a file from Xvc tracking and optionally deletes it from the local filesystem, cache, and the storages.

It only works if the file is tracked by Xvc.

```console
$ git init
...

$ xvc init

$ xvc file track 'd*.txt'

$ xvc file list
FC          19 [..] c85f3e81 c85f3e81 data.txt
FX         130 [..]          ac46bf74 .xvcignore
FX         191 [..]          d3815b7e .gitignore
Total #: 3 Workspace Size:         340 Cached Size:          19


```

Without any options, it removes the file from Xvc tracking and the cache.

```admonition warning

`xvc file untrack` doesn't modify the `.gitignore` files to remove the previously tracked files. You must do it manually if you want to track the file with Git.

```

```console
$ xvc file untrack data.txt

$ git status
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean

```

If you have [rechecked](/concepts/recheck.md) the file as symlink or reflink, it will be copied to the workspace.

```console
$ xvc file track data.txt --as symlink

$ ls -l

$ xvc file untrack data.txt

$ ls -l
```

If there are multiple versions of the file, it removes them all and restores the latest version.

If you want to restore all versions of the file, you can specify a directory to restore them.

```console
$ xvc file track data.txt

$ perl -pi -e 's/a/e/g' data.txt

$ xvc file carry-in data.txt

$ xvc file untrack data.txt --restore-versions data-versions/

$ ls -l data-versions/
```

With `--delete-from-storages`, this command removes the cached files from (remote) storages.

```console
$ xvc file track data.txt

$ xvc storage new local --name local-storage --path '../local-storage'

$ xvc file send data.txt --to local-storage

$ xvc file untrack data.txt --delete-from-storages local-storage
```

If multiple paths are pointing to the same cache file (with deduplication), the cache file will not be
deleted. In this case, `untrack` reports other paths pointing to the same cache file. You must untrack all of them to
delete the cache file.

```console
$ xvc file track data.txt

$ xvc file copy data.txt data2.txt --as symlink

$ xvc file untrack data.txt

$ ls -lR .xvc/b3/

$ xvc file untrack data2.txt

$ ls -lR .xvc/b3/
```
